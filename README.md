## Introduction

This project is a compiler for the BUAA compilation course major assignment - SysY language (a subset of C) based on the MIPS architecture. The compiler converts input SysY language code into MIPS language assembly code that can run on MARS.

## Usage

Windows users can download the exe format file from the GitHub Release and run it directly as follows:

```
compiler.exe
```

This program compiles the SysY language code from ``testfile.txt`` and outputs the MIPS language assembly code to ``mips.txt``.
